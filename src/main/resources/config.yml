# The server to check
server-ip: "pvphub.me"

# What method should we use to determine if a user has voted?
#
#  "SYNC" - Sync and cache all likes for this server. We will look in
#           the array of users who have liked to determine if someone
#           has liked the server. (Automatic, slower)
#
#  "SINGLE" - A player must execute the "/namemc liked" command to
#             check if they have liked the server. (Manual, faster)
#
method: SYNC

sync-settings:
  # How often should we refresh the list of users who have liked? (Milliseconds)
  refresh-period: 30000

single-settings:
  # We're making a GET request (async) each time the command is executed, we should
  # probably rate limit the user to make sure they can't spam web requests (Milliseconds)
  command-cooldown: 30000
  cooldown-message: "&cPlease wait 30s before checking again!"

# How should we store if we've already rewarded players for liking the server?
#
#  "YAML" - Create a data file to store a list of UUIDs that we have already rewarded.
#
#  "LP_PERMISSION" - Give player who have been rewarded a permission node.
#
#  "LP_META" - Use LuckPerms meta to store if a single user has already been rewarded.
